## 2. Monte Carlo Simualtion

A Monte Carlo simulation assesses the portfolio's risk and return by generating random scenarios. It reveals potential outcomes and uncertainty. Comparing the results to the actual backtest cumulative return validates the analysis. This approach improves decision-making and risk management in stock investments.
